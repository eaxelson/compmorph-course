# # COMPUTATIONAL MORPHOLOGY WITH HFST TOOLS - LECTURE 6
#
# ## 1. Two-level rules
#
# Recall the finite-state transducer for I&P English noun inflection (from lecture 1):

#
# ```
# Example input:    ‚àÖsky+N+Pl+Poss
# Example output:   ‚àÖsky^  s  '
# ```
# 
# Xfst rules are placed in a series.
# We compose our lexicon with our rewrite rules (called ‚Äúreplace rules‚Äù in xfst)
# and  produce one single FST that ‚Äújumps‚Äù from the lexical-form input straight to
# the final output in one go, without producing the intermediate steps.
#

#
# ```
# Example input:  sky+N+Pl+Poss
# Lexicon output: sky^s'
# Rule 1 output:  sky^es
# Rule 2 output:  ski^es
# Rule 3 output:  skies
# ```
#
# The single FST will give directly: sky+N+Pl+Poss ü°í skies.
# 
# The order of the rules matters!
