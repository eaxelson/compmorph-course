# Jupyter notebook files for course Computational Morphology with HFST.

This web course is based largely on the course ”Computational Morphology” (https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/LDA-T3101/120259674) held at the University of Helsinki spring 2018.
The course was taught and planned by Mathias Creutz. Senka Drobac also contributed to the exercises.
The web course uses the same examples and exercises, but HFST command line tools have been replaced with HFST Python interface (https://pypi.org/project/hfst-dev/).

The course is divided into seven parts, corresponding to the original lectures 1–3 and 5–8.

1. Theories of morphology, generators and analyzers, lexc
2. Finite-state basics, xfst rules
3. Disambiguation, probabilities, finite-state networks summarized
4. (no tutorial for this lecture)
5. Guessers, stemmers, regular expressions in xfst
6. Twolc, two-level rules
7. Flag diacritics, non-concatenative morphology
8. Optimization of finite-state networks

First part is in Lecture1/Lecture.ipynb, second part in Lecture2/Lecture.ipynb and so on.
Go to the directory and click Lecture.ipynb so the notebook opens.
