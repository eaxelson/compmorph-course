# ## 1. Finite-State Basics

# Recall the finite-state transducer (FST) for purely concatenative I&A (Item and Arrangement)

# The yellow circles represent _states_ or _nodes_ and the arrows represent _transitions_
# or _arcs_ between states. Each transition consumes an input symbol and produces an output symbol.
# The special symbol Îµ (the epsilon) on the input side means that no symbol is consumed
# and on the output side that no symbol is produced when following a given transition.
#
# A finite-state network that has only input symbols in the transitions is called
# a finite-state automaton (FSA). It does not produce output, but just recognizes
# (or rejects) input. Finite-state automaton for a 3-word language:

# * Inputs to the automaton are _symbols_ like: m, e, c.
# * The set of valid symbols that the automaton will accept is its _alphabet_: { a, c, e, g, i, m, n, o, r, s, t }.
# * The sequences of symbols that the automaton will accept are _words_ like: canto, mesa.
# * The entire set of words that the automaton accepts or recognizes is its _language_: { canto, mesa, tigre }.

# Removing a word from a minimal network may actually increase the size of the network!
